        <p>Environmental science is a major and minor at F&M. You will study the environment through a blended lens of biology, chemistry, and geology. This program will prepare you to evaluate and address key environmental problems by helping you develop critical, science-based decision-making skills. Your learning won’t take place in the classroom alone; it’s only fitting to study environmental science by venturing out into the environment itself. You’ll engage in exciting hands-on outdoor learning; dive into your findings in the lab; and embark on independent and collaborative research—all while utilizing F&M’s cutting-edge field, laboratory, and computing equipment.</p>
        <img alt="students fishing" src="/_resources/images/images/bg-program-listing.png">
        <strong>By the time you graduate, you will:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Have developed an understanding of the environment rooted in the fields of biology, chemistry, and geology</li>
          <li>Understand the interactions between humans and natural environmental systems in the past, present, and future</li>
          <li>Be able to describe various indicators of environmental change, including global, regional and local change (including climate change); water and air quality; ecosystem resilience; biodiversity; natural resource use; and human population</li>
          <li>Develop critical, science-based decision-making to help you understand and improve environmental issues such as land use; the conservation of endangered species; habitat degradation; the impacts of global change on animals, plants, and humans; water and energy resources; and pollution</li>
          <li>Evaluate real-world applications of scientific analysis to study environmental challenges, and understand how such analyses inform policy responses to human-induced environmental change</li>
        </ul>

        <p>F&M’s location provides the perfect landscape for studying environmental science. Lancaster County’s flourishing agricultural scene, the nearby Susquehanna River, and F&M’s Millport and Spalding nature conservancies provide exciting learning opportunities outside of the classroom. It’s also not uncommon for students to work alongside their professors and become an integral part of their ongoing research.</p>

        <h3>Research Opportunities</h3>
        <p>As you become fully immersed in your environmental science studies, you may find yourself forming theories or questions. The good news? You don’t have to wait until graduate school to investigate. Every student at F&M has extraordinary opportunities to <a href="#">engage in independent</a> or <a href="#">faculty-led research</a>.</p>

        <p>Environmental science faculty are expert researchers working on a wide array of environmental topics, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wetland and floodplain restoration (Dorothy Merritts and Robert Walter, professors of geosciences)</li>
          <li>Trace metal cycling in the marine environment (Jennifer Morford, professor of chemistry)</li>
          <li>Environmental change and extinction in modern and ancient marine environments (Carol de Wet, professor of geosciences)</li>
          <li>Understanding and predicting responses of aquatic communities and organisms to environmental change (Peter Fields, Janet Fischer, Mark Olson, Joe Thompson, professors of biology)</li>
          <Li>Soil biogeochemistry, carbon cycling and global change (Chris Williams, professor of environmental science)</Li>
          <li>Plant physiology, ecophysiology, and ecology (Sybil Gotsch and Timothy Sipe, associate professors of biology)</li>
