        - paragraph: 'It is not enough to be a voice for the voiceless.'

        - paragraph: '“Instead, your challenge and mine is to listen for unheard voices and to abolish the conditions of voicelessness,” said author Viet Thanh Nguyen at Franklin & Marshall College’s May 14 Commencement.'

        - paragraph: 'Addressing the Class of 2022’s 560 grads honored at the Alumni Sports & Fitness Center, Nguyen shared the story of finding his voice with both solemnity and levity.'

        - paragraph: '“Being a refugee was quite traumatic. But it wasn’t all bad. Being a refugee left me with the requisite emotional damage necessary to become a writer,” joked Nguyen, author of “The Sympathizer,” the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner.'

        - paragraph: '“Being a refugee also leaves me with an opinion that not all of you may agree with, which is that I think refugees—and immigrants—make America great,” he said.'

        - paragraph: 'A palpable energy filled the ASFC—one part jubilation, one part collective exhalation after a pandemic-disrupted academic journey.'

        - paragraph: '“Four years both short and endless. Four times through the academic cycle, each year different from the others, each painful and victorious in their own ways,” said F&M President Barbara Altmann, who arrived on campus in 2018 when most of the graduates began their F&M studies.'

      copy:
        - paragraph: 'The sea of colorful cords, stoles and decorated caps reflected the diversity, hardships and successes of the Class of 2022.'

        - paragraph: 'Williamson medalist Hailan Yu has been unable to visit her home country of China or see her family in person for over 850 days.'

        - paragraph: '“Forced to change my plans, I used that time to take classes, to do research, to browse through graduate school programs to figure out my true interests,” Yu said.'

        - paragraph: '“We adapted when the world paused and drove us to be flexible,” said class president Trinity Nguyen, a first-generation college student and Vietnamese immigrant who nominated this year’s Commencement speaker.'

        - paragraph: 'Altmann likened the outgoing class’s experience to a meditation labyrinth near campus—“not the kind with dead-ends and blind alleys, but the kind with only one path that curls and twists from an entry point along a circuitous route,” she said.'

        - paragraph: '“You’ve been engaged in that kind of labyrinth,” Altmann said. “You can revisit old haunts to unwind from somewhere you’ve been stuck in the past, or you can follow a spiral that passes familiar places on your way to a higher vantage point.”'

        - paragraph: 'Highlights of the ceremony included faculty award winners and honorary degree recipients Nadia Chaudhri ’99 (posthumous), Peter Feigin ’92 and Allison O’Toole ’93.'

        - paragraph: 'With the traditional passing of the torch, applause filled the ASFC once more as graduates triumphantly raised diplomas and tossed mortarboards.'

        - paragraph: '“Class of 2022, it’s all over, and yet it’s all just beginning. I hope we hear your voices in the future, and I hope we hear your voices now,” Viet Thanh Ngyuen said.'
